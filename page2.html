                            <p class="card-text">I thoroughly enjoyed just about every aspect of this project, from Tinkercad, to sketching, to drawing out measurements, and examining my prints, everything was great. Oh wait I forgot about my fails…, those weren’t so fun. I started off this project sketching a simple idea of two different cars split in half, where I would take a half from each car model, held together by a hinge on the side. In the middle of the cars there would be a space for mints to go, where parchment paper could be placed so you wouldn’t be eating plastic. My idea for this mint dispenser changed dramatically, in the end I had the same car model split in half, and used the hinge at the rear of the car. I originally printed a car cut in half with no modifications, and a hasp and pins just to get a print on that day. These models helped me better understand how my entire project would work, and made me realize that my original idea was flawed.  In Tinkercad I needed to be very precise with how deep I was putting the hole so I wouldn’t go all the way through the car. This required me to do a lot of measurements of the parameters of my car in tinkercad and even perform some basic arithmetic. Putting the hasps on the back of the car halves was also a challenging process that required precise measurements. After my design was ready I exported it to Prusa Splicer where I made no modifications and made the print. The print was a total fail as seen in the picture above. Vincent told me it was an adhesion problem, and I assumed it was just the printer itself that was the problem. I then tried to one next to it and the same thing happened. I then thought it may be the way I was printing it and flipped it, but my third attempt still failed. On my third attempt I stuck around long enough to see the fail with my own eyes. Only a small part of the car was actually printed. Ian recommended that I look at the brim features on prusa to see if it was printing the full bottom layer, as a matter of fact it wasn’t. I then went back into Tinkercad and lowered the design so the entire first layer was being printed, and the print was a success! The successful z height for me was -1.288. Today I came in and saw my print and was excited because it looked exact9ly how I wanted it. Unfortunately when merging the hasps to the back ends of the car halves, I made them exactly the distance apart that they should be. I did not account for the fact that you need room to actually press the hasps into one another so that the pin can slide through. This was an easy fix with a filer. However, there was one problem that could not be remedied. On one of the car halves I printed the hasp too close to the car, and part of the hole was missing. This meant that no matter how much I tried the holes would never line up. I did not have time given the time allotted for this project, but in the future I want to build a successful car mint dispenser, and adjust these simple mistakes. All I need to do is move the hasp away from the car a little bit and shorten the hasp a bit so that it can line up with the one on the other car half. Even though the car did not achieve my goal of making it a functional mint dispenser, I believe it was a good design that I can and will modify to be a success!</p>
