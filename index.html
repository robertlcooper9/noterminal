                            <p class="card-text">This project entailed a lot of first experiences for me: my first time building anything even close to a 3D printer, my first time using code, and my first time doing web design. I picked up a lot of great skills I can use in the future, but I’ll certainly need more practice. A week and a half is not enough time for me to become even close to an expert on web design. The first part of the project that I mentioned was assembling the printers. We split into groups of two to assemble a Prusa MINI+ 3D printer. I worked with Alex on this project. We unboxed the parts, tried to lay them out in an organized way, then got to work. We had a comprehensive manual to follow the whole time which we certainly would not have been able to get by without. Getting started seemed a little overwhelming, with so many miscellaneous pieces just lying around. Once we got going the process went a lot smoother, and the more progress we made, the more motivated we became. The assembly entailed screwing various pieces together, wiring pieces through one another, and for the filament base, simply clicking pieces together. We finished with little time to spare, but our printer looked as good as any other, and it certainly felt good to be able to say that I assembled it. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">
The second part of the project was designing the website for the project. This was definitely the more challenging part for me. As I mentioned, I have no coding or website design experience, so this was quite overwhelming. Luckily, Professor Roy posted a great tutorial on how to do everything. The bootleg was great for understanding the basics, and understanding what the purpose of the code was; however, I did not find it to be an entirely helpful reference in the actual building of my website. In designing my website, the first thing I did was download Sublime Text and open the HTML file in a new tab so that I could see the website and the code at the same time. Most of the process was just exchanging texts in the template for what I wanted. For example, exchanging “Welcome to Blog Home!” with “Robert Cooper’s projects in ENGR 11a.” This was the easy part, uploading pictures was a bit more challenging because this entailed writing new code and writing the file organization in the code. However, once I had one picture formatted the rest were easy. I also played a bit with text features (mostly colors) using code from another site “CSS Text.” Some features that I played with weren’t super helpful, like text shadow. My final website I feel has a good layout and hopefully is easy to understand. I hope you all enjoy my project! Thanks for reading!</p>

                               <p class="card-text">Alex and I assembled a Prusa MINI+ 3D Printer. In general, the instructions were very reader friendly, with well-organized sections. The instructions were colorful and well designed so as not to bore the reader. They even had instructions at various sections to eat some gummy bears that were provided, this was just a way to make sure those assembling the printer were taking care of themselves as well, setting aside times for brakes so that they can think about the project with a more level head. The manual was well organized in that it had one side explaining the directions, and the opposite side explaining fixing, troubleshooting, calibration of the 3D printer, loading of filament etc... The instructions were laid out well enough that despite neither of us being the most handy of people, we ended up finishing the build in class time. </p>

                              <h2 class="card-title">Reflection on Instructions and the Process</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">
As the process went on, I progressed at visualizing placement before looking at the instructions. In the beginning of the process, I was barely looking up, solely relying on the manual to guide me. After a while, I was making mistakes that I would have caught had I been more conscious of the materials I was working with. About halfway through, Vincent showed a very simple layout of what was going where and why, and from this point on everything flowed a lot smoother. Understanding what I was doing was key in me being able to catch my own mistakes. I wonder why the instructions don’t say why they say a step, for example, “screw this piece A into piece B so that….”. I feel that in parts that “so that” aspect was missing and I wonder why. I think Alex and I worked best when we were asking each other questions. It was great when we would at each step ask each other how?, what?, why?; to make sure we were doing everything correctly, even though most of the time we were. Mistakes arose when we weren’t questioning each other and our general progress. If I wrote the Prusa Documentation, I would definitely add in more of the “so that”, so the reader can better understand the reasoning for what they are doing. Definitely a great experience that I think I could perform more efficiently were I to assemble another Prusa printer, or a similar machine.</p>

                            <h2 class="card-title">Benchy Boat!</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">I made my first ever 3D print after assembling the 3D printer. I used a Benchy to test out the 3D printer and get experience printing. It felt good seeing what we had just assembled create something cool. The Benchy was a mini tug boat. We agreed to print the Benchy in light green. When I set the calibration, it seemed well aligned and I had a feeling it was going to be a good print– as it turns out I was right. Our print looked almost exactly the same as the model Benchy with minimal differences. Our print was smooth, well layered, and looked nearly identical to the best ones in the room. I wish I could say I remember or documented our calibration settings, but I didn’t. I believe the z axis was set at about -1.3, I think it could've been a little bit closer for a smoother print, but overall it was a good print. In future projects, I’ll definitely be sure that I’m documenting everything.</p>

                            <h2 class="card-title">Model Benchy Comparison and Shortcomings</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">Our print went smoothly, so the main shortcomings of the print were caught leading up to the print. Although we finished building the printer within class time, we did not have enough time to carry out the print. I went a couple days after to office hours with Professor Rogers to complete the print. The first time I was setting the calibration, I went a bit too low without noticing. As it started to print, the filament was clearly not how it should be (it was very clear and stringy). I then scraped off the leftover filament and tried again. This time around, the Prusa nozzle was not too close and not too far from the print surface. The filament showed up in a darker more defined color and I had a feeling it was gonna be a good print. Again, I’m not sure the exact settings, and it would definitely be helpful to know, but raising the nozzle only slightly was likely what made all the difference. </p>
