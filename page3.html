                            <p class="card-text">Before this class I had never soldered before, and didn’t even have a concrete idea of what soldering was. For my first time I think it went pretty well. My partner Natasha seemed to pick it up a bit quicker than I did. I was struggling to get the solder to not clump up, I needed a fine hershey kiss like shape, but got a clump of goo. It was only after Vincent showed me a trick to soldering where you first heat the area you want to solder with the iron, and then the solder should smoothly form. After this trick it was mostly smooth sailing. However, because I didn’t figure this out sooner our alarm clock wouldn’t turn on, there was too much solder in the wrong places, and not enough in the right places. I know soldering is a useful skill to have from small projects to issues with lights in a car, so I’m very thankful that I got to learn it. While Natasha was finishing up the last of our soldering I took measurements of the model alarm clock that was already assembled with a caliper. It turns out you need to be extremely careful with how you record measurements! I took probably close to 20 measurements and tried to lay them out on one box I drew that was a model of the alarm clock. However, that many measurements on that small space was a big mistake. I later retook the measurements on our own alarm clock and learned from this mistake, separating the components better when I recorded measurements again. Some of the important measurements I took were the dimensions of the box which I recorded to be roughly 97mm by 48mm. I also recorded the clock display boxes to be roughly 10mm by 10mm. I also recorded measurements of the buzzer, the dials, and space between everything. Our design stage did not go great, largely because one of us was still working on soldering while the other was navigating the design process alone. It was especially difficult because both of us had seen a lot of videos on Fusion, but when push came to shove we both really only knew how to make a box, so that’s what we did. We printed a plain box with an opening and did not fit any of the features to it. We just made an opening so the alarm clock could fit inside and thought maybe we could make a lid later. Later on in the project I had some cool ideas about fitting it inside a box and fitting that box inside a cowboy hat, or something cool like that. But, by the time I thought to do this I was already having so many fitting issues, and the project was already nearly done. It seemed more important just to get something that could get the features that we specifically needed. In our first print of the white box enclosure we exported it to Prusa and printed it without any structural support because we figured it was a box and wouldn’t need any. The layer height was 0.15mm and the first layer height was 0.2mm, with a minimum shell thickness of 0.7mm. I think all of our settings were fine, the print went well, it just wasn’t very well fit, the alarm clock was very loose inside. After this I sought to design a better fitting alarm clock by having layers where I created a top and a bottom that fit together from just sketches. While I designed this Natasha designed something that we thought could maybe be the back to the enclosure to hold the 9 volt battery. Making the sketch was a struggle, especially with so many bodies and so many unfinished sketches that showed up as ghosts in Fusion. It took me a 2 hour office hour just to fit the buzzer. I made a lot of constraints but the design still did not fit well. Not only did it not fit well,  but the alarm clock didn’t even have room to fit inside my econclosure because I made a lip which meant the box could close, but left almost no room for the alarm clock to sit. I also tried to design a new port in the back that had a lip, this also did not fit. Part of the reason I was so stingy with my millimeters in my fit was because the first print was so loose, but I need to remember that it’s different printer to printer. In the end I didn’t have enough time to repeat this print and try again so we had to work with what we had. The back piece to the fit I designed was useless so we scrapped that, but the top still technically could fit all the required components (though not in the finest fashion). Our final product consisted of my design at the top glued to the loose fit box with the alarm clock inside glued to the back with the port for the battery which fit the battery but we had to use gorilla tape to keep the battery in place (but hey, easy to change). It was a bit scuffed, but in the end we met the requirements and had a final product that looked like an alarm clock in the land of misfit alarm clocks. The project really forced me to dive head first nearly blindfolded into Fusion, but this was the best part of the project. I now feel I have a decent understanding of Fusion and would be able to make a far better product the next time by doing simple things like adding tolerance in parameters, using less bodies, and making sure I don’t have too many miscellaneous sketches. </p>
