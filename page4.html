                            <p class="card-text"> In project 4 my partner Aiden and I worked to assemble an Unlimbited phoenix prosthetic hand model. Although the hand was not fit for anyone, the point of building it was so that we can understand the process now and get good at it for when we actually need to fit a client for a prosthetic part. A few days before we started the build I 3D printed all the hand parts. Unfortunately, I forgot to scale it by 150% as was instructed, so I had to reprint the next day. The next day I had all the good prints but still was missing a few parts. Luckily there were extra’s of all of our missing parts in the front of the room. I printed all on Prusa's because all of the raised 3D printers were taken. As a result, I could only print so many parts at a time, and I borrowed previously printed parts, which meant we were going to have one colorful hand! I printed my layer height to be 0.15mm, my first layer height to be 0.2mm, with a minimum shell thickness of 0.7mm, and a z offset of 0 for each print. All the prints in total took about 40 hours, but this was when I did 2 days of printing. One mistake with the prints was that I made a 0.2 mm raft when I should’ve made a 0.4mm raft because the layer was so thin that it needed to be scraped off rather than just broken off. It took us about 30 minutes to cleanly remove all the rafts. Before actually building the hand, we first watched a video on the building process, and then later read through online instructions. We both agreed that a video would be easy to follow along as we did it, but there were times where it was helpful to see a still image because at times the person recording the video’s hand would be blocking the view. The place the file was put online made sense, it was just a simple download that came up immediately when I searched for instructions, and the video also was very easy to find. For the most part it wasn’t a terribly hard build, I’m sure the trickiest part would’ve been thermoforming the gauntlet, but Vincent did that for us. There were a few times where we messed up little things like putting the joints on backwards, but it was very easy to see when we went wrong just by experimenting with the hands motion a bit, making backtracking quite convenient. I think the most confusing part was trying to get the strings through the hand. This was not super difficult and we figured it out relatively quickly, but there was a little while where we were a bit confused. We kept looking at the video, but the person in the video’s hand was blocking our view of the strings orientation. This was the point where I decided still instructions might be better and it really helped us. An online manual, and a few tips from Ian and we were well on our way. I think the only thing I would change about the video instructions is making sure the viewer can see where the string goes. What I would change about the written instructions is possibly combining a few steps, the manual I looked up had a lot of really similar steps that could’ve been written as one to be more concise and less of a headache to follow. I really don’t think we could’ve documented the process much better aside from what I just pointed out, the document’s formatting was generally very user friendly and the video was extremely easy to follow along to. The assembly was for the most part a blast! It was a project where you immediately could see your progress, and could tell immediately what it was you were building, with each step adding more functionality. I think if I were to build one of these hands in the future I could definitely do it a lot more efficiently and probably without having to look at the instructions, so I’m glad I got this first taste of how to build it. A change to this hand that I think would help the client perform better in day to day tasks would be a pad on the palm of the hand wrapped around the hand that could be taken off. The main tasks I thought this could help with include moving the gear selector on a car, pressing against a wall, and even simple breakdancing. The pad would provide friction for various tasks where you need a strong grip. This would be a removable pad because there are likely many situations where it’s easier just to have the normal hand. In many situations the pad may make the hand too bulky to grab things. Although it’s a pretty basic concept, I feel it could serve a lot of people well. </p>
