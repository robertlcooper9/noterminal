                            <h2 class="card-title">Reflection</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">Our group has had quite a struggle finding a client, between Gill and I we have probably called about 35 people. Originally our ideal client was a disabled veteran with an upper limb difference, but we have not had no success finding a disabled veteran to work with, so we have broadened our client pool to anyone with need for a prosthetic arm. This person will perform many everyday tasks over the course of a day, from picking up things, to turning a door knob. They will need a versatile prosthetic arm. We tried to find our client by calling VA offices, Disabled American Veterans, emailing the Brandeis engineer Greg for contacts, and I even reached out to a lot of the veterans service groups at the Brandeis career fair, all with no luck. Once we broadened our client pool Gill reached out to a lot of prosthesis labs, which gave him contacts, that gave him another contact, but a lot of people ultimately said they would get back to him, so hopefully it works out. We created an email template that we have largely copied when writing all our emails, but emails have not been very successful. The only meeting we have had so far was a phone call with a Brandeis alumni and marine Charles Frangis. We made a list of questions to ask in the first meeting to help us better understand the client we would be working with through the words of Charles. We asked Charles about finding a potential client, but we also asked him what the everyday life of a veteran was. We are hoping he can get us in touch with someone in need of a prosthesis, but mostly the meeting was helpful because he gave us some ideas of more places to look. Charles gave us a contact of his own who is a Captain in the marines, but he also gave us the idea of contacting veteran homeless shelters. We have not set up a time yet for a second meeting, because we are waiting for Charles to let us know when he has updates with his contacts, then we will meet again. If we were to get a meeting with a potential client some questions  we would ask include, “What does a typical day look like for you?,” “How long have you had an upper limb difference?,” “What is the most challenging aspect of having an upper limb difference?,” “Is there something we could design that would fit a specific need for you in an upper limb prosthesis?” To design a good product for them we will need to know the size of their arm, what they do on a day to day basis, and what common movements they make. If we get a client we will structure the first meeting to ideally be in person, but if not over zoom. We would like a half an hour to an hour with the client. The meeting would be professional, but also relaxed so we could make the client comfortable with us designing for them. The only prototype that we have now that we would like to bring to a meeting is the “Unlimbited Phoenix Hand” that we built in class. We did not want to do much prototyping just yet because we wanted to dedicate our time to finding a client. We did two design methodologies, one was an empathy activity, thinking about the clients needs, and the other was thinking about potential designs in terms of feasibility versus impact. One problem we identified is that a client may have poor weight distribution between their arm and their prosthetic arm. We want to balance this out by making careful weight considerations, and we debated and fused several ways of doing that from our original five ideas which we ranked. Five ideas we came up with were hanging led weights off the arm, interchangeable weighted sleeves, using heavier plastic, using multiple layers with PLA, TPU, and fabric for comfort and better weight distribution, and lastly various heavy metals attached to the top of the hand. The overwhelming amount of our time was spent making calls and sending emails. It would be great to build an open source device, but I think all of us really want to have that experience of working with a client, so we will continue to push to get a client, but if it doesn’t work out I’m sure we will design a great open source device for someone to use down the line.</p>
