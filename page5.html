                            <p class="card-text">This project was an awesome challenge that got us to sink our teeth into a new tool. In this project we got a chance to use the Brandeis engineering classe’s brand new laser cutters. We used them to fit the alarm clock we had previously soldered, and its battery into a laser cut box that each student designed on Fusion360. This process really started even before the project began. The night before we started the project we were assigned to design a laser cut box based on an online tutorial. This was not something terribly challenging because the video was telling us exactly how to do it, were I to do it without the video, which is what the actual project entailed, it would be much more difficult. In the video I learned some very useful Fusion features, not just for laser cutting but for 3D printing as well. Mirroring bodies and sketches saves so much time and is definitely something I will be doing more in the future. In our actual class time we began by creating sketches for our design. Thinking about this project from the lens of a 3D print I came up with sketch 1 shown above that ended up being a total fail. In this design I thought wood stops would be a great simple idea, and they probably would’ve been on a Prusa. However, when I laser cut my design from Fusion it made holes where I wanted wood stops, which makes perfect sense in hindsight. My second design was a bit better, but still not great. In this design I tried to make a box that had a removable front fit with holes for the dials, buttons, and buzzer for the clock. In this design I made it a good fit, but I needed a longer box so I could hold the 9 volt battery. This was an easy fix, but there were some missing joints, and there were certain constraints that I set up in my unorganized sketches that made this issue very challenging to resolve. After trying for hours on Wednesday, and into Thursday, I ultimately decided to start fresh, and start simple. My new design, and ultimately my final design was inspired partly on my old joint design, and partly on Vincent’s design. In my new design I used a joint box, but instead of having a face, I had a stick going through two holes. This part was based on Vincent’s design, I thought this would work well in giving the clock something to lean on to hold it in place. Although it doesn't have holes to fit all the buttons and dials, it meets all the requirements. The design had enough room in the box for the battery to fit, you could easily access the buttons, dials, and hear the buzzer (if I had soldered well and the alarm clock worked). Making the individual sketches into 2D DXF files was a bit confusing at first, but after I found the good instructions that Professor Rogers sent in Slack it made sense and was smooth sailing. I had some problems in selecting the various parts of the sketches that I wanted to project in my second design, this was part of the reason I ultimately scrapped it. I could select some party that needed to be cut, but not others. The process taught me the importance of having a well organized Fusion sketch. I used the software LightBurn for all of my prints, using a 3 millimeter MDF particle board with the laser settings set to a speed of 20 millimeters per second, and at 100% power, all cut on the Mira 7. My design definitely works, and that ‘s what’s important. However, in the future I would like to play with things like the clips Vincent designed that allow for more flexibility. In this design in particular I think it may be beneficial to have multiple sticks going through the middle for more support on both sides. Also, for the next project if I name my images project 6, and then type the name of the image, they will be well organized and easy to find within my images folder, and then easy to put on my website (Just a side note).</p>
